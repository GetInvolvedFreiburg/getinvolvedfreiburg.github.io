The variety of those events is incredible and it is also possible to get founding and support for own events. The student Council looks forward to committed and dedicated students that love to put time and effort in the planning of events.<br>To participate singular times in events is possible and completely normal. You will experience a loving and caring atmosphere no matter if and how often you participate. Everyone is glad when people show up but its is also more than just okay to skip events and do something else instead or nothing at all.<br>The peer advising events are the perfect opportunity to get to know your studies, the campus and your own peers better and can really help to get around the first couple of weeks better. It can be an excellent opportunity to meet new friends, get new inputs and expand your own horizon. I highly recommend attending them and asking questions that you care about profoundly.</p>',
